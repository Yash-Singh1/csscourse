background-image
----

Sets the image in the background. Overrides background-color. Also takes
gradients (see gradients.txt).

background-color
----

Sets the color in the background. Can be used in conjunction
with background-image for larger images that take time to load
as a color for it. Only one color is allowed.

background-size
----

How large the background should be.

background-size: <width>;
background-size: <width> <height>; /* Overrides the aspect ratio of the width to the height */

Note that above you can also set width or height to auto for automatically calculating it based on the aspect ratio.

background-size: cover; /* Automatically fills the entire container */


background-repeat
----

How many times it should repeat and whether it even should.

background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Doesn't repeat the background image if given more space */
background-repeat: repeat; /* Default */
background-repeat: repeat-x; /* Repeat it horizontally only */
background-repeat: repeat-y; /* Repeat it vertically only */

background-position
----

The positioning of the background on the element. Pixel values
define how much whitespace there should be on the sides of the image
while percentages give how much of it should be zoomed in where.

background-position: 10px;            /* X-axis only */
background-position: 10px 20px;       /* Both X and Y */
background-position: 10%;             /* Crop out the other 10% on the left */
background-position: 10% 20%;         /* Crop out 10% on left, 20% on top */
background-position: top 3% left 10%; /* From top 3% and left side 10% */

background-origin
----

The part of the box-model to include the background into. Accepts values of
padding-box, border-box, content-box, etc.

background-clip
----

Where to crop the image of the box model. Overrides background-origin.

background-attachment
----

Defines if the background scrolls with and how it behaves with scrolling.

background shorthand
----

background: <image> <position>/<size> <repeat> [<origin> <clip> | <originAndClip>]
background: <color>;

Can contain multiple backgrounds seperated by a comma.
