Both gradients are only allowed to be put on the background-image value.

linear-gradient
----

This allows you to add a gradient or transition of colors.

At minimum takes two colors:

linear-gradient(red, blue)

Here is the format:

linear-gradient([direction, ] [...[color [amount]]])

Where direction is in the format:

to ((top|bottom) (left|right)|top|bottom|left|right)

Which defines starting from the opposite of the given to the given direction.

You can also specify an angle measure, e.g. 350deg.

Where amount is any measuring unit such as pixels, percentage, etc.

Where color is any unit which represents a solid color.

radial-gradient
----

This allows you to add an eliptical shape that transitions to the outer
rings into different colors.

The syntax is the same as the one for linear-gradient except the direction
syntax is completely different.

Where direction is the format:

(ellipse [dimensions-keyword|length length]|circle [dimensions keyword|length])[at pos]

Where length is a CSS length unit (width/height for ellipse and diameter for circle) and dimension-keyword
is one of farthest-corner, closest-corner, farthest-side, closest-side. This defines where the side of the
ellipse will touch.

Where pos is either one or two CSS lengths defining relative to the top and left or a
keyword like those for direction in linear-gradient (e.g. top bottom, left, etc.).
