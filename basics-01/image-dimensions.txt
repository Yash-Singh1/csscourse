An image by default uses the height and width in the image's dimensions itself. The <img>
tag by default will not inherit any width or height set to the surrounding container.

Setting the height to 100% is not an alternative because it would still be relative to the dimensions
of the original image.

But you can still use inline-block in the container in which the above won't apply.
