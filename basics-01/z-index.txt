z-index: auto; -> z-index: 0; (Has other side effects read more about stacking context)

z-index: <integer>; -> higher the integer, the higher in the stack

The z-index won't have any impact if the position is static.

If two elements have the same z-index, the stack will be respected by the document flow.
