By default an <li> tag takes the whole entire width. This is the behavior of display: block;

Take the following code:

<li>
  <p>Text</p>
  <p>Text 2</p>
</li>

This would render as:

- Text Text 2

Because the <p> tag has a display set to inline.
Setting it to inline would remove features such as padding, width, height, and margin.
If we want there to be a line break, we would do:

<li>
  <p>Text</p>
  <p style="display: block;">Text 2</p>
</li>

Which would render as:

- Text
  Text 2

This is because now the "Text 2" takes the whole width.

Setting the display to none, removes it from the document, making it invisible.

Setting the display to inline-block mixes up block and inline aligning everything next to each other.
This means that it will be inline and have features such as padding and margin.
