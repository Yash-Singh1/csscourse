position: static;
----

This means that all top, bottom, right, left values are ignored
and the elements are positioned by the document flow.

position: fixed;
----

Takes the element out of the document flow. The positioning context
changes to the viewport. Also has a side-effect of a inline-block like
behavior. Works with block/inline level elements too.

position: absolute;
----

Absolute and doesn't scroll down with scrolling. The positioning context
is the lowest ancestor that has a position property set to something other
than static. Difference between fixed is the positioning context depends.

position: relative;
----

The element isn't taken out of the document flow and the positioning context
is relative to itself. This can be useful also when trying to add a position
value of something other than static without breaking your site.

position: sticky;
----

Hybrid of relative and fixed. Doesn't take the element out of the document flow.
The top, bottom, right, and left properties define when relative to the viewport
the fixed behavior should start. It stops the fixed behavior when the end of the
parent element's content is reached.
